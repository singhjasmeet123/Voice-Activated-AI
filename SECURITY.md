# Security Policy

## Overview
This security policy outlines the measures and guidelines to ensure the security and integrity of the Voice-Activated AI application. The application uses various APIs, including the Gemini API, which requires special attention due to the inclusion of hardcoded API keys.

## Supported Versions
I recommend using the latest version of the Voice-Activated AI application to benefit from the most recent security updates and patches. The following versions are actively supported:

| Version | Status              | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark:   | Regular          |
| 0.x     | :x:                 | Not Supported    |

Please upgrade to the latest version if you are using an unsupported version to ensure your application is secure.

## Security Practices

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys
The application uses hardcoded API keys to connect to the Gemini API. To protect these keys:
- **Limit Access**: Ensure that only trusted developers and contributors have access to the source code.
- **Environment Variables**: In future versions, we recommend transitioning from hardcoded API keys to environment variables to enhance security.
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and update the application accordingly.
- **Minimize Exposure**: Avoid sharing or exposing the code publicly unless the keys are removed or replaced with placeholders.

### 2. Data Protection
The application may handle sensitive user data through voice commands and responses. To ensure data protection:
- **Encryption**: Ensure that all data transmitted between the application and external APIs is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the application to function.
- **Secure Storage**: Avoid storing sensitive user data unless absolutely necessary, and ensure any stored data is encrypted.

### 3. Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: Implement thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks and other common vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing detailed error messages that could reveal internal logic or sensitive information.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update all dependencies and third-party libraries to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: If applicable, implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit user privileges based on their roles.
- **Session Management**: Ensure that user sessions are securely managed and terminated after inactivity or logout.

### 5. Vulnerability Management
I encourage the community to report any vulnerabilities found in the application. To report a vulnerability, please follow the guidelines below:

#### Reporting a Vulnerability
- **Contact Information**: Email your findings to [jmalhotra799@gmail.com](mailto:jmalhotra799@gmail.com).
- **Details**: Include as much detail as possible, including the nature of the vulnerability, how it was discovered, and steps to reproduce it.
- **Response Time**: I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and strive to provide a detailed response within 7 days.

### 6. Regular Security Audits
I conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. I also welcome contributions from the community to help improve the security of the application.

## Future Enhancements
- **API Key Management**: Implement a more secure method for managing API keys, such as using a secure vault or dynamic key generation.
- **Security Testing**: Integrate automated security testing into the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- **User Education**: Provide documentation and guidelines to users on how to securely use the application.

## Conclusion
Security is a top priority for my Voice-Activated AI application. I am committed to maintaining and improving the security of the application and appreciate the support of the community in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities.

Thank you for helping me keep the application secure!
